## REVISED ABOUT SECTION

### Meet Your Practitioner

**Jessica Montana, L.Ac.**
Arizona Acupuncture License #012201 | 14+ Years Clinical Experience | NUHS Graduate 2010

Somewhere between a doctor's visit and a massage appointment — that's what you can expect in my clinic. I'm not a doctor, but there will be a comprehensive health history intake to understand your physical, emotional, and spiritual needs before we begin.

I am passionate about helping people slow down and self-regulate. Change happens in a unique way through acupuncture, cupping, e-stim, and neurofeedback. Every client I work with is different, and I celebrate that uniqueness. The modalities I use are effective, natural, and deliver results — I'm only interested in offering what works to restore the body and brain at the root cause.

Together, we'll discover whether you're dealing with nutrient deficiencies, environmental toxicity, blockages, or all three. My goal is to support you in having a calm mind, a strong body, and a resilient spirit.

A 2010 graduate of National University of Health Sciences in Chicago, I've spent over 14 years developing expertise across acupuncture, Traditional Chinese Medicine, Brainpaint neurofeedback, cupping, gua sha, and lifestyle medicine. My early career included extensive fertility acupuncture training with renowned specialist Peter Harvey, and I continue advancing my knowledge in detoxification, nutritional counseling, and environmental toxin support.

While you're resting with the needles in, I encourage my patients to take an "acunap." Even if I'm sitting in the room with you, I encourage quietude — I want your inner guidance to come forward. When the inner noise settles, openness and ease begin to emerge. Many people fall completely asleep or feel a deep presence that comes with true rest.

When not in the clinic, you can find me hiking Arizona's beautiful landscapes, swimming, gardening, practicing yoga, preparing healthy meals, or enjoying time with my two beloved dogs.

## NEW VETERANS SECTION

### Serving Those Who Served

I have a deep reverence for those who have served and currently serve our beautiful country. Both of my grandfathers were veterans, and I've carried a patriotic spirit since childhood. This work is my way of giving back.

The opioid crisis hit our veteran community hard, and that is not something I take lightly. We know that opioids foster addiction and impede the body's natural ability to manage issues like insomnia while disrupting the gut biome. Acupuncture and cupping offer a different path — they promote rest and relaxation by interrupting the pain signal to the brain, moving us away from stress, trauma, and pain without pharmaceuticals.

These modalities also improve the function of the gut, liver, kidneys, lungs, and other major organs. With each session, we're increasing resilience and decreasing vulnerabilities.

Here in Tucson, I have an incredible opportunity to offer natural solutions for veterans dealing with pain, PTSD, and other service-connected conditions. If you've never tried acupuncture, I welcome you to come in — even if you're skeptical. Symptoms typically improve across sessions, but results can sometimes be immediate. I recently worked with a 91-year-old patient in extreme pain whose pain levels dropped to zero after the first session. It doesn't always happen like that, but it can and does.

An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. If you're hearing an alarm bell going off in your body, please don't wait until you're experiencing a full-on health crisis. The time is now.

I am here to help you untangle confusing and sometimes scary health issues and get you back on track. I believe everyone deserves to live a balanced, peaceful, and pain-free life.

**VA patients:** I currently see veterans who schedule in person or by phone. Call or text to get started.

## NOTES FOR GREG

**What changed in the About section:**
- Replaced the third-person resume style with Jessica's first-person voice from the mission statement
- Wove in her philosophy (root cause, terrain support, slowing down)
- Kept all credentials but made them feel secondary to her personality
- Included the "acunap" concept — it's memorable and differentiating
- Removed references to Amandha Dawn Vollmer (not necessary for the website and could be controversial depending on audience)

**What the Veterans section does:**
- Gives her veteran focus real visibility and its own nav link
- Positions acupuncture as an opioid alternative (strong messaging)
- Uses her personal connection (grandfathers) for authenticity
- Includes the 91-year-old patient story — great social proof
- Ends with clear direction for VA patients on how to schedule

**Writing cleanup throughout:**
- Fixed "kidney's" → "kidneys"
- Fixed "nutrient deficiency" → "nutrient deficiencies"
- Tightened sentences, removed some repetition
- Kept her warmth, directness, and personality

**Removed Amandha Vollmer reference — flagging this for your awareness:**
Amandha Dawn Vollmer is controversial in some circles (anti-vaccine, alternative health claims that have drawn criticism). Having her name on the website could hurt Jessica's credibility with certain audiences, especially VA-referred patients. Worth a conversation with Jessica about whether to include this.
